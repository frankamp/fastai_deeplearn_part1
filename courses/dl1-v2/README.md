# Deep Learning Homework

These are the recommended tasks:
- go through the notebooks presented in class, read the extra text that is in the notebook and try changing the hyperparameters to better understand them
- choose a dataset of your own and replicate the notebook
- get started on the Kaggle competitions
- read [blogs](https://github.com/reshamas/fastai_deeplearn_part1/blob/master/resources.md)
- it is expected to watch the videos 2 to 4 times (from Lesson 1 to Lesson 7) to grasp concepts more fully
